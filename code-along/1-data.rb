# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 3
# puts 5

# # Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5 + 2
# puts 5 -2
# puts 5 * 2
# puts 5 / 2

# # Integer versus floats
# puts 6.0 / 9.0

# Strings
puts "Hello, world!"

# Combine strings together
puts "Tacos are " + "delish"
puts "tacos" * 3
puts "tacos" + 3.to_s

# Variables
a = 10
b = 3
puts a * b

food = "tacos"
quantity = 3
puts food * quantity

first_name = "Boba"
#greeting = "Hello, " + first_name
greeting = "Hello, #{first_name}"
puts greeting


# Combine strings and variables

# String manipulation

puts "Hello".reverse
