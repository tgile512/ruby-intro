# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = ["tacos", "pizza", "ice cream"]
#puts favorite_foods

# we_have_to_go_back = [4, 8 , 15, 16, 23, 42]
# puts we_have_to_go_back

# mixed_array = ["tacos", 12, true]
# puts mixed_array

# Accessing the array
puts favorite_foods[0]
puts favorite_foods[1]
puts favorite_foods[2]
puts favorite_foods[3]
